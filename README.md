# Python Learning Journey 🐍

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This is where I document my progress, practice codes, and projects as I embark on the journey to master Python. 🌟

## 📚 About This Repository

I am currently pursuing honors in **Applied Statistics and Data Science** at the University of Dhaka. As part of my goal to gain expertise in programming and data science, I am learning Python through various resources, starting with the **Complete Python Bootcamp** course on Udemy.  

In this repository, you will find:
- My practice codes from the bootcamp.
- Notes, examples, and mini-projects.
- Real-world applications of Python concepts.
